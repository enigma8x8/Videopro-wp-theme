# Video Player Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully updated the video functionality in the VideoProjects theme to use file uploads instead of URL links and implemented a modern Bootstrap-based video player.

## Changes Made

### 1. ACF Field Changes

- **Old**: `service_video_url` (URL field)
- **New**: `service_video_file` (File upload field)
- **Supported formats**: mp4, mov, avi, webm

### 2. Template Updates

- Updated `single-services.php` to use the new video file field
- Implemented Bootstrap responsive video player with `ratio ratio-16x9`
- Added fallback for when only image is available (no video file)

### 3. CSS Styling

- Added new video player styles in `assets/css/style.css`
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Custom styling for video controls
- Placeholder styling for when video is not available

### 4. JavaScript Enhancements

- Updated `assets/js/functions.js` with new video player functionality
- Added custom play button overlay
- Event listeners for video loading and error handling
- Responsive behavior

### 5. Bootstrap Icons

- Added Bootstrap Icons CDN link in `functions.php`
- Used for play button and other UI elements

## How to Use

### For Content Editors:

1. Go to any service page in WordPress admin
2. In the "Video fails" field, upload a video file (mp4, mov, avi, webm)
3. Optionally add a background image in "Video fona attÄ“ls"
4. Fill in video author and description if needed
5. Save the page

### For Developers:

The video player uses these classes:

- `.video-holder` - Main video container with background
- `.bg-video` - Video element (muted, playsinline)
- `.details` - Overlay with video information
- `.play-btn` - Custom play button
- `.title` - Video title in overlay
- `.author` - Author information in overlay
- `.description` - Video description in overlay

**Video Holder Structure**:

```html
<div
  class="video-holder"
  style="background: url('image.jpg') center center / cover no-repeat;"
>
  <video muted playsinline class="bg-video">
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <div class="details">
    <button type="button" class="play-btn"></button>
    <h3 class="title">Video Title</h3>
    <span class="author">Author: <strong>Name</strong></span>
    <p class="description">Video description</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
